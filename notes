old code for making masks ....

strategy :

loop over images, resample them to reasonable isomorphic dimensions ...
pad resampled image to a consistent dimension, throw into pytables
    hopefully compression will take care of sparse zero regions

generator looping over pytables array:

for each image:
    for each cube:
        is nodule contained in cube?
        (this works, but would need loss weights)


^ could iterate over top to produce two downstream datasets that could be subsampled
    list of nodules
    list of controls


Alternatively, could get around the padding problem and just store smaller cubes
    might need to resample on each run :(
    would need to select cube size ahead of time :(
    we've got the space, so perhaps storing padded full images is best
